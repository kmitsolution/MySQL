### Common Data Types in MySQL

When creating tables in MySQL, it’s important to choose the appropriate data types for each column to ensure data integrity and optimize performance. Here’s a breakdown of the common data types categorized into three main groups: Numeric, String, and Date/Time.

#### 1. Numeric Data Types

Numeric data types are used to store numbers. They can be divided into two categories: integers and floating-point numbers.

- **Integer Types**:
  - **TINYINT**: A very small integer (1 byte). Range: -128 to 127 or 0 to 255 (unsigned).
  - **SMALLINT**: A small integer (2 bytes). Range: -32,768 to 32,767 or 0 to 65,535 (unsigned).
  - **MEDIUMINT**: A medium-sized integer (3 bytes). Range: -8,388,608 to 8,388,607 or 0 to 16,777,215 (unsigned).
  - **INT** or **INTEGER**: A standard integer (4 bytes). Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 or 0 to 4,294,967,295 (unsigned).
  - **BIGINT**: A large integer (8 bytes). Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 or 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (unsigned).

- **Floating-Point Types**:
  - **FLOAT**: A small floating-point number (4 bytes). Precision: up to 7 decimal digits.
  - **DOUBLE**: A double-precision floating-point number (8 bytes). Precision: up to 15 decimal digits.
  - **DECIMAL** or **NUMERIC**: A fixed-point number. You can specify precision and scale (e.g., DECIMAL(10,2) allows for 10 digits total, with 2 after the decimal point).

#### 2. String Data Types

String data types are used to store text data. They vary in size and behavior.

- **CHAR**: A fixed-length string. If the string is shorter than the defined length, it is padded with spaces. (e.g., `CHAR(10)` always stores 10 characters.)
  
- **VARCHAR**: A variable-length string. It can store up to 65,535 characters and only uses as much space as needed.
  
- **TEXT**: A large text string. It can store up to 65,535 characters and is used for long strings of text (e.g., descriptions or articles).
  
- **MEDIUMTEXT**: Can store up to 16,777,215 characters (useful for very large texts).
  
- **LONGTEXT**: Can store up to 4,294,967,295 characters (ideal for extremely large texts).
  
- **BINARY**: A fixed-length binary string. Similar to `CHAR`, but for binary data.
  
- **VARBINARY**: A variable-length binary string. Similar to `VARCHAR`, but for binary data.

#### 3. Date/Time Data Types

Date and time data types are used to store date and time values.

- **DATE**: Stores dates in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Range: '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'.
  
- **DATETIME**: Stores date and time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. Range: '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'.
  
- **TIMESTAMP**: Stores a timestamp value, automatically updated on record modification. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. Range: '1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-19 03:14:07' UTC.
  
- **TIME**: Stores time in the format `HH:MM:SS`. Range: '-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'.
  
- **YEAR**: Stores a year in either a 2-digit or 4-digit format. (e.g., `YEAR(4)` for four-digit years).

### Conclusion

Choosing the right data types when creating tables in MySQL is crucial for data integrity, performance, and storage efficiency. Understanding the characteristics of numeric, string, and date/time data types allows you to design a robust database schema that meets your application's requirements.
